/**
 * This TextGraphics implementation wraps another TextGraphics and forwards all operations to it, but with a few
 * differences. First of all, each individual character being printed is printed twice. Secondly, if you call
 * {@code getSize()}, it will return a size that has half the width of the underlying TextGraphics. This presents the
 * writable view as somewhat squared, since normally terminal characters are twice as tall as wide. You can see some
 * examples of how this looks by running the Triangle test in {@code com.googlecode.lanterna.screen.ScreenTriangleTest}
 * and compare it when running with the --square parameter and without.
