/**
 * This interface exposes functionality to 'draw' text graphics on a section of the terminal. It has several
 * implementation for the different levels, including one for Terminal, one for Screen and one which is used by the
 * TextGUI system to draw components. They are all very similar and has a lot of graphics functionality in
 * AbstractTextGraphics.
 * <p>
 * The basic concept behind a TextGraphics implementation is that it keeps a state on four things:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Foreground color</li>
 *     <li>Background color</li>
 *     <li>Modifiers</li>
 *     <li>Tab-expanding behaviour</li>
 * </ul>
 * These call all be altered through ordinary set* methods, but some will be altered as the result of performing one of
 * the 'drawing' operations. See the documentation to each method for further information (for example, putString).
 * <p>
 * Don't hold on to your TextGraphics objects for too long; ideally create them and let them be GC:ed when you are done
 * with them. The reason is that not all implementations will handle the underlying terminal changing size.
