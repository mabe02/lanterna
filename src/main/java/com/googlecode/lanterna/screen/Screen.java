/**
 * Screen is a fundamental layer in Lanterna, presenting the terminal as a bitmap-like surface where you can perform
 * smaller in-memory operations to a back-buffer, effectively painting out the terminal as you'd like it, and then call
 * {@code refresh} to have the screen automatically apply the changes in the back-buffer to the real terminal. The 
 * screen tracks what's visible through a front-buffer, but this is completely managed internally and cannot be expected
 * to know what the terminal looks like if it's being modified externally.
 * <p>
 * If you want to do more complicated drawing operations, please see the class {@code DefaultScreenWriter} which has many
 * utility methods that works on Screens.
