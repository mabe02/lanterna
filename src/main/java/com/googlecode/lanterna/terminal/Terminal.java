/**
 * This is the main terminal interface, at the lowest level supported by Lanterna. You can write your own
 * implementation of this if you want to target an exotic text terminal specification or another graphical environment
 * (like SWT), but you should probably extend {@code AbstractTerminal} instead of implementing this interface directly.
 * <p>
 * The normal way you interact in Java with a terminal is through the standard output (System.out) and standard error
 * (System.err) and it's usually through printing text only. This interface abstracts a terminal at a more fundamental
 * level, expressing methods for not only printing text but also changing colors, moving the cursor new positions,
 * enable special modifiers and get notified when the terminal's size has changed.
 * <p>
 * If you want to write an application that has a very precise control of the terminal, this is the
 * interface you should be programming against.
