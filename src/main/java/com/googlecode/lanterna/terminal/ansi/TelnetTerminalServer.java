/**
 * This class implements a Telnet server, capable of accepting multiple clients and presenting each one as their own
 * Terminal. You need to tell it at least what port to listen on and then it create a Server socket listening for
 * incoming connections. Use {@code acceptConnection()} to wait for the next incoming connection, it will be returned as
 * a {@code TelnetTerminal} object that represents the client and which will be the way for the server to send content
 * to this client. Next connecting client (through {@code acceptConnection()} will get a different
 * {@code TelnetTerminal}, i.e. their content will not be in sync automatically but considered as two different
 * terminals.
