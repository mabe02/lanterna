/**
 * A layout manager is a class that takes an area of usable space and a list of components to fit on that space. This
 * is very similar to how AWT/Swing/SWT works. Lanterna contains a number of layout managers built-in that will arrange
 * components in various ways, but you can also write your own. The typical way of providing customization and tuning,
 * so the layout manager can distinguish between components and treat them in different ways, is to create a class
 * and/or objects based on the {@code LayoutData} object, which can be assigned to each {@code Component}.
