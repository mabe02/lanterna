/**
 * BasePane is the base container in a Text GUI. A text gui may have several base panes, although they are
 * always independent. One common example of this is a multi-window system where each window is a base pane. Think of
 * the base pane as a root container, the ultimate parent of all components added to a GUI. When you use
 * {@code MultiWindowTextGUI}, the background space behind the windows is a {@code BasePane} too, just like each of the
 * windows. They are all drawn separately and composited together. Every {@code BasePane} has a single component that
 * is drawn over the entire area the {@code BasePane} is occupying, it's very likely you want to set this component to
 * be a container of some sort, probably a {@code Panel}, that can host multiple child components.
