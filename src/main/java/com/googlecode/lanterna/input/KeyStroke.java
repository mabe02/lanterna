/**
 * Represents the user pressing a key on the keyboard. If the user held down ctrl and/or alt before pressing the key, 
 * this may be recorded in this class, depending on the terminal implementation and if such information in available.
 * KeyStroke objects are normally constructed by a KeyDecodingProfile, which works off a character stream that likely
 * coming from the system's standard input. Because of this, the class can only represent what can be read and 
 * interpreted from the input stream; for example, certain key-combinations like ctrl+i is indistinguishable from a tab
 * key press.
 * <p>
 * Use the <tt>keyType</tt> field to determine what kind of key was pressed. For ordinary letters, numbers and symbols, the 
 * <tt>keyType</tt> will be <tt>KeyType.Character</tt> and the actual character value of the key is in the 
 * <tt>character</tt> field. Please note that return (\n) and tab (\t) are not sorted under type <tt>KeyType.Character</tt>
 * but <tt>KeyType.Enter</tt> and <tt>KeyType.Tab</tt> instead.
