        In the third tutorial, we will look at using the next layer available in Lanterna, which is built on top of the
        Terminal interface you saw in tutorial 1 and 2.

        A Screen works similar to double-buffered video memory, it has two surfaces than can be directly addressed and
        modified and by calling a special method that content of the back-buffer is move to the front. Instead of pixels
        though, a Screen holds two text character surfaces (front and back) which corresponds to each "cell" in the
        terminal. You can freely modify the back "buffer" and you can read from the front "buffer", calling the
        refreshScreen() method to copy content from the back buffer to the front buffer, which will make Lanterna also
        apply the changes so that the user can see them in the terminal.

            implementation that allows you to create a terminal surface that is bigger than the physical size of the
            terminal emulator the software is running in. Just to demonstrate that a Screen sits on top of a Terminal,
