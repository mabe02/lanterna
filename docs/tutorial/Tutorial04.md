Tutorial 4
---

In this forth tutorial we will finally look at creating a multi-window text GUI, all based on text. Just like
the `Screen`-layer in the previous tutorial was based on the lower-level `Terminal` layer, the GUI classes we will
use here are all build upon the Screen interface. Because of this, if you use these classes, you should never
interact with the underlying Screen that backs the GUI directly, as it might modify the screen in a way the
GUI isn't aware of.

The GUI system is designed around a background surface that is usually static, but can have components, and
multiple windows. The recommended approach it to make all windows modal and not let the user switch between
windows, but the latter can also be done. Components are added to windows by using a layout manager that
determines the position of each component.

    DefaultTerminalFactory terminalFactory = new DefaultTerminalFactory();
    Screen screen = null;
    
    try {

The `DefaultTerminalFactory` class does not provide any helper method for creating a Text GUI, you'll need to
get a `Screen` like we did in the previous tutorial and start it so it puts the terminal in private mode.

    screen = terminalFactory.createScreen();
    screen.startScreen();

There are a couple of different constructors to `MultiWindowTextGUI`, we are going to go with the defaults for
most of these values. The one thing to consider is threading; with the default options, lanterna will use
the calling thread for all UI operations which mean that you are basically letting the calling thread block
until the GUI is shut down. There is a separate `TextGUIThread` implementation you can use if you'd like
Lanterna to create a dedicated UI thread and not lock the caller. Just like with AWT and Swing, you should
be scheduling any kind of UI operation to always run on the UI thread but lanterna tries to be best-effort
if you attempt to mutate the GUI from another thread. Another default setting that will be applied is that
the background of the GUI will be solid blue.


    final WindowBasedTextGUI textGUI = new MultiWindowTextGUI(screen);

Creating a new window is relatively uncomplicated, you can optionally supply a title for the window

    final Window window = new BasicWindow("My Root Window");

The `Window` has no content initially, you need to call `setComponent(..)` to populate it with something. In this
case, and quite often in fact, you'll want to use more than one component so we'll create a composite
`Panel` component that can hold multiple sub-components. This is where we decide what the layout manager
should be.

    Panel contentPanel = new Panel(new GridLayout(2));

Lanterna contains a number of built-in layout managers, the simplest one being `LinearLayout` that simply
arranges components in either a horizontal or a vertical line. In this tutorial, we'll use the `GridLayout`
which is based on the layout manager with the same name in SWT. In the constructor above we have
specified that we want to have a grid with two columns, below we customize the layout further by adding
some spacing between the columns.

    GridLayout gridLayout = (GridLayout)contentPanel.getLayoutManager();
    gridLayout.setHorizontalSpacing(3);

One of the most basic components is the `Label`, which simply displays a static text. In the example below,
we use the layout data field attached to each component to give the layout manager extra hints about how it
should be placed. Obviously the layout data has to be created from the same layout manager as the container
is using, otherwise it will be ignored.

    Label title = new Label("This is a label that spans two columns");
    title.setLayoutData(GridLayout.createLayoutData(
            GridLayout.Alignment.BEGINNING, // Horizontal alignment in the grid cell if the cell is larger than the component's preferred size
            GridLayout.Alignment.BEGINNING, // Vertical alignment in the grid cell if the cell is larger than the component's preferred size
            true,       // Give the component extra horizontal space if available
            false,        // Give the component extra vertical space if available
            2,                  // Horizontal span
            1));                  // Vertical span
    contentPanel.addComponent(title);


Since the grid has two columns, we can do something like this to add components when we don't need to
customize them any further.

    contentPanel.addComponent(new Label("Text Box (aligned)"));
    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new TextBox()
                .setLayoutData(GridLayout.createLayoutData(GridLayout.Alignment.BEGINNING, GridLayout.Alignment.CENTER)));

Here is an example of customizing the regular `TextBox` component so it masks the content and can work for
password input.

    contentPanel.addComponent(new Label("Password Box (right aligned)"));
    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new TextBox()
                .setMask('*')
                .setLayoutData(GridLayout.createLayoutData(GridLayout.Alignment.END, GridLayout.Alignment.CENTER)));

While we are not going to demonstrate all components here, here is an example of `ComboBox`es, one that is
read-only and one that is editable.

    contentPanel.addComponent(new Label("Read-only Combo Box (forced size)"));
    List<String> timezonesAsStrings = new ArrayList<String>();
    for(String id: TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()) {
        timezonesAsStrings.add(id);
    }
    ComboBox<String> readOnlyComboBox = new ComboBox<String>(timezonesAsStrings);
    readOnlyComboBox.setReadOnly(true);
    readOnlyComboBox.setPreferredSize(new TerminalSize(20, 1));
    contentPanel.addComponent(readOnlyComboBox);
    
    contentPanel.addComponent(new Label("Editable Combo Box (filled)"));
    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new ComboBox<String>("Item #1", "Item #2", "Item #3", "Item #4")
                    .setReadOnly(false)
                    .setLayoutData(GridLayout.createHorizontallyFilledLayoutData(1)));

Some user interactables, like `Button`s, work by registering callback methods. In this example here, we're
using one of the pre-defined dialogs when the button is triggered.

    contentPanel.addComponent(new Label("Button (centered)"));
    contentPanel.addComponent(new Button("Button", new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            MessageDialog.showMessageDialog(textGUI, "MessageBox", "This is a message box", MessageDialogButton.OK);
        }
    }).setLayoutData(GridLayout.createLayoutData(GridLayout.Alignment.CENTER, GridLayout.Alignment.CENTER)));

Close off with an empty row and a separator, then a button to close the window

    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new EmptySpace()
                    .setLayoutData(
                            GridLayout.createHorizontallyFilledLayoutData(2)));
    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new Separator(Direction.HORIZONTAL)
                    .setLayoutData(
                            GridLayout.createHorizontallyFilledLayoutData(2)));
    contentPanel.addComponent(
            new Button("Close", new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    window.close();
                }
            }).setLayoutData(
                    GridLayout.createHorizontallyEndAlignedLayoutData(2)));

We now have the content panel fully populated with components. A common mistake is to forget to attach it to
the window, so let's make sure to do that.

    window.setComponent(contentPanel);

Now the `Window` is created and fully populated. As discussed above regarding the threading model, we have the
option to fire off the GUI here and then later on decide when we want to stop it. In order for this to work,
you need a dedicated UI thread to run all the GUI operations, usually done by passing in a
`SeparateTextGUIThread` object when you create the `TextGUI`. In this tutorial, we are using the conceptually
simpler `SameTextGUIThread`, which essentially hijacks the caller thread and uses it as the GUI thread until
some stop condition is met. The absolutely simplest way to do this is to simply ask lanterna to display the
window and wait for it to be closed. This will initiate the event loop and make the GUI functional. In the
"Close" button above, we tied a call to the `close()` method on the Window object when the button is
triggered, this will then break the event loop and our call finally returns.

    textGUI.addWindowAndWait(window);

When our call has returned, the window is closed and no longer visible. The screen still contains the last
state the `TextGUI` left it in, so we can easily add and display another window without any flickering. In
this case, we want to shut down the whole thing and return to the ordinary prompt. We just need to stop the
underlying `Screen` for this, the `TextGUI` system does not require any additional disassembly.

    }
    catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    finally {
        if(screen != null) {
            try {
                screen.stopScreen();
            }
            catch(IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
